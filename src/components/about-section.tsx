                        I didn't start building to change the world. I built to stop being annoyed.

                        I got tired of manually inputting game stats, so I built a platform that scans images and calculates for you. 
                        Across five months and countless reworks, it has received 140,000+ page views.
                        Another issue that really irked me: machine translations of webnovels were still headache inducing, while humans took ages.
                        I built an AI system that achieves a 78% preference over baseline translations, only costing $0.004 per chapter.

                        Turns out my annoyances are pretty universal â€” these tools now serve 13,000+ users across 100 countries.
                        I primarily work full-stack for control and customization, while also integrating AI/ML for ease and efficiency (sometimes cost).
                        Currently, I'm exploring personalization algorithms as a Software Engineer Intern at Lumeno AI.
