# Portfolio

My personal portfolio website built with Next.js, TypeScript, React Flow, and Tailwind CSS.

## About

This is my portfolio showcasing my work as a Computer Science student. It features some of the projects I've built serving real users, including gaming platforms, AI/ML pipelines, and web applications with measurable impact.

The site includes interactive React Flow graphs, smooth Motion animations, glassmorphic design, and responsive behavior. Built from scratch with modern web development practices and technical depth.
